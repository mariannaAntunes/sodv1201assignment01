                <p>That's why I'm now living in Calgary/CA as an international student. Here I have the opportunity to get to know different places, people and cultures and improve my career development.
                  I'm also close to one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen: the Rocky Mountains!</p>

            <p>I have a degree in Chemical Engineering and a postgraduate degree in Safety Engineering.
              Now I'm studying Software Development at Bow Valley College in a diploma program. I believe that it will open up new opportunities to grow and develop my carrer.
